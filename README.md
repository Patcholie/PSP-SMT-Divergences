## üß≠ PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS

### The Art of Market Intelligence

Technical analysis is more than predicting price movements‚Äîit's about understanding market dynamics, recognizing patterns, and developing a probabilistic approach to trading.

#### Core Principles
- **Probabilistic Thinking**: Markets are complex adaptive systems
- **Contextual Analysis**: Look beyond individual signals
- **Adaptive Intelligence**: Markets constantly evolve
- **Risk Management**: Preservation of capital is paramount

> üí° **FUNDAMENTAL INSIGHT**:
> No indicator can predict the future with certainty. Success comes from understanding market probabilities and managing risk.

## üîç INTRODUCTION

### Precision Candles & SMT Divergence Indicator: Your Market Analysis Companion

The Precision Candles & SMT Divergence indicator is an advanced technical analysis tool designed to identify potential reversal and continuation points through two complementary methods:

1. **PSP (Precision Swing Points)**: 
   - Detects when the main chart symbol and a comparison symbol move in opposite directions
   - Will Provide enhanced swing point filtering ( Currently can show swing points )
   - Reveals relative market strength and momentum
   - Use in relation to P&D levels.




2. **SMT Divergence**: 
   - Identifies divergences between price action and technical indicators
   - Analyzes multiple timeframe levels
   - Highlights potential trend reversals and continuations

> **CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**: 
> This is an ANALYTICAL TOOL, not a trading system. It provides insights, not guaranteed signals.

## üî¨ SIGNAL INTERPRETATION PRINCIPLES

### Understanding PSP Signals

#### Bullish PSP Signal
**Occurs when:**
- Comparison symbol candle is bearish (red)
- Main chart symbol candle is bullish (green)

**Indicates:** Relative strength against comparison symbol

#### Bearish PSP Signal
**Occurs when:**
- Comparison symbol candle is bullish (green)
- Main chart symbol candle is bearish (red)

**Indicates:** Relative weakness against comparison symbol

### Signal Strength Factors

| Factor | Strong Signal | Weak Signal |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Correlation** | Above 0.7 | Below 0.5 |
| **Candle Size** | Large, decisive | Small, indecisive |
| **Market Context** | Aligned with trend | Against trend |
| **Volume** | High volume | Low volume |

    (Correlation Strength * 0.3) +
    (Divergence Strength * 0.3) +
    (PSP Signal Quality * 0.2) +
    (Volume Confirmation * 0.2)
```
