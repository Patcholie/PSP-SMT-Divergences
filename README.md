## üîç INTRODUCTION

The **Precision Candles & SMT Divergence Indicator** is an advanced technical analysis tool designed to identify potential market reversals and continuation patterns through two complementary methods:

1. **PSP (Precision Swing Points)**: Detects when the main chart symbol and comparison symbols move in opposite directions, revealing relative strength and weakness.

2. **SMT Divergence**: Identifies divergences between price action and technical indicators across multiple timeframe levels.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**:  
> This is an ANALYTICAL TOOL, not an automated trading system. It provides insights that require interpretation, not guaranteed signals. Always use proper risk management.

## üß† SIGNAL INTERPRETATION

### üìó Bullish PSP Signal

**Occurs when:**
- Comparison symbol candle is bearish (red)
- Main chart symbol candle is bullish (green)

**Indicates:** Relative strength against the comparison symbol

**Best used when:**
- Occurs at a swing low
- Correlates with bullish divergence
- Correlation is above minimum threshold
- During an established uptrend or at potential reversal points

### üìï Bearish PSP Signal

**Occurs when:**
- Comparison symbol candle is bullish (green)
- Main chart symbol candle is bearish (red)

**Indicates:** Relative weakness against the comparison symbol

**Best used when:**
- Occurs at a swing high
- Correlates with bearish divergence
- Correlation is above minimum threshold
- During an established downtrend or at potential reversal points

### üìà Divergence Signal Quality Factors

| Factor | Strong Signal | Weak Signal |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Price Movement | Clear higher/lower highs/lows | Sideways choppy price action |
| Indicator Movement | Strong opposite direction to price | Slight opposite direction |
| Timeframe Alignment | Multiple timeframes show divergence | Only one timeframe shows divergence |
| Volume | Increasing on pivots | Declining on pivots |
| Market Context | Occurs near support/resistance | Occurs in no-man's-land |

> üîç **EXAMPLE**:  
> A bullish divergence occurs when price makes a lower low but the indicator makes a higher low. This suggests weakening downward momentum and a potential reversal.

## üé≤ TRADING STRATEGIES

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ PSP Reversal Strategy

**Setup:**
1. Identify a strong trend
2. Wait for a pullback against the trend
3. Look for PSP signal in the direction of the main trend
4. Confirm with divergence if possible

**Entry:**
- Enter at the open of the candle following the PSP signal

**Stop-Loss:**
- Place stop below/above the PSP signal candle

**Take-Profit:**
- Target the next significant support/resistance level
- OR use a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Symbol Consensus Strategy

**Setup:**
1. Enable 2-3 highly correlated comparison symbols
2. Set Signal Generation Mode to "All"
3. Wait for consensus signal (all symbols agree)

**Entry:**
- Enter at the open of the candle following the consensus signal

**Stop-Loss:**
- Place stop at recent swing high/low

**Take-Profit:**
- Use previous swing high/low as target
- OR implement trailing stop once in profit

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Divergence Confirmation Strategy

**Setup:**
1. Identify significant divergence on primary timeframe
2. Wait for PSP signal in the same direction
3. Verify correlation is above 0.7

**Entry:**
- Enter on break of PSP signal candle high/low

**Stop-Loss:**
- Place stop beyond the divergence pivot point

**Take-Profit:**
- Target the previous swing high/low
- OR use measured move (distance of divergence formation)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**:  
> Always combine this indicator with other forms of analysis. Never trade based solely on these signals.

## üîß OPTIMIZATION TIPS

### Performance Optimization

1. **Reduce Visual Elements**
   - Disable additional comparison symbols
   - Use "Primary Only" display mode
   - Limit the maximum number of divergence lines

2. **Focus Computation**
   - Enable only the fractal periods you actually use
   - Use Primary fractal only for faster charts
   - Set higher minimum strength to filter weak signals

3. **Display Optimization**
   - Consider using Monochrome Mode for cleaner visuals
   - Reduce zone opacity for less visual clutter
   - Disable labels if not needed

### Parameter Tuning by Timeframe

| Timeframe | Fractal Settings | Lookback | Swing Threshold |
|-----------|------------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1-5 min | Primary: 2, Secondary: 5 | 1 | 0.1% |
| 15-30 min | Primary: 2, Secondary: 7 | 2 | 0.2% |
| 1-4 hour | Primary: 3, Secondary: 9 | 2-3 | 0.3-0.5% |
| Daily | Primary: 5, Secondary: 13 | 3 | 0.5-1.0% |
| Weekly | Primary: 8, Secondary: 21 | 3-5 | 1.0-2.0% |

### Market-Specific Adjustments

| Market Type | Correlation Threshold | Signal Mode | Special Considerations |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Trending | 0.5 | Any | Focus on hidden divergences |
| Ranging | 0.7 | All | Focus on regular divergences |
| Volatile | 0.8 | All | Increase swing threshold |
| Low Volatility | 0.6 | Any | Decrease swing threshold |

> üí° **TIP**:  
> Backtest your settings during different market conditions. What works in trending markets might not work in ranging markets.

## ‚ùì TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Too Many Signals | Sensitivity too high | Increase strength filter, use "All" signal mode |
| Too Few Signals | Sensitivity too low | Decrease strength filter, use "Any" signal mode |
| Missed Important Moves | Timeframe mismatch | Try different fractal periods, check correlation |
| Correlation Always Low | Wrong comparison symbol | Select a more correlated instrument |
| Excessive Visual Clutter | Too many elements enabled | Use monochrome mode, reduce opacity, limit lines |
| Slow Chart Performance | Excessive calculations | Reduce max bars back, disable tertiary fractals |
| No Divergences Showing | Strength filter too high | Lower minimum strength, enable both divergence types |

### Checking Signal Quality

**Good PSP Signal Characteristics:**
- Occurs at significant swing points
- Has strong correlation (>0.7)
- Clear candle pattern (decisive move)
- Alignment with overall trend or at reversal points
- Confirmed by divergence

**Poor PSP Signal Characteristics:**
- Occurs in choppy price action
- Low correlation (<0.5)
- Small, indecisive candles
- Contradicts higher timeframe trend
- No divergence confirmation

> üîç **EXAMPLE**:  
> If you get too many signals in choppy markets, try increasing the minimum correlation to 0.8 and using the "All" signal mode with multiple comparison symbols.
